# EVI-AI  
## Eyes for the Visually Impaired  

This project aims to assist individuals with visual impairments in their daily activities. It employs an application that uses the mobile phone's camera to identify objects and gauge their distances. The app then leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to interpret the findings from the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection and ZoeDepth perception models. This information is converted into audio commands, guiding users to navigate their environment more effectively.  

## Project Overview

The main components of this project include:  

- A mobile application written in Flutter  
- A YOLO object detection model  
- A ZoeDepth detection model  
- A llama2 LLM model
